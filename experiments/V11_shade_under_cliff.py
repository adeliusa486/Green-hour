"""V11 -- does SHADE still work when the grid response is a cliff?

This is the experiment the reviewer called "probably the most important
technical experiment": V10 showed the piecewise response changes the SIZE and
COMPOSITION of the equilibrium gap, but said nothing about whether the mechanism
still closes it.  If SHADE only works against the smooth quadratic it was
derived from, the mechanism contribution is an artefact of the approximation.

Three configurations, all evaluated against the CLIFF social cost and the CLIFF
planner:

  nash            uncorrected equilibrium (agents charged a_t + b_t*y_t)
  shade-smooth    SHADE with the adder it uses today: built from the smooth
                  beta_t.  MISSPECIFIED under a cliff -- the clearinghouse
                  believes a curvature the grid does not have.
  shade-cliff     SHADE with an adder built from the true piecewise marginal
                  evaluated at the published aggregate.  This is what a
                  clearinghouse that knew the headroom would publish.

The gap between shade-smooth and shade-cliff is the price of model
misspecification, and it is the number a referee should be shown: it says
whether the mechanism degrades gracefully when the world is not quadratic.

SYNTHETIC.
