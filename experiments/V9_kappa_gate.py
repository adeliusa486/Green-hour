"""V9 -- where does the strategic share cross the Plan A threshold?

V6 measured the accounting/strategic decomposition at kappa in {0.5,1,2,4} and
found the strategic share running 2.4% -> 12.7%.  The improvement plan sets the
Plan A / Plan B gate at ~15%: above it the mechanism carries the paper, below it
the paper is reframed around measurement and accounting.

E1 will report a single kappa per region.  This sweep says what that number has
to be for the gate to open, so the calibration can be read against a threshold
instead of a vibe.  It also extends the range upward, since V5's addendum showed
the *total* gap is non-monotone while the *share* is monotone -- the share is the
quantity the gate is defined on, so it is the one to extrapolate.

Synthetic instances.  This does not replace E1; it parameterises the decision.
